# Sentences and Clauses

## Sentences

A sentence is an expression of meaningful in it own right.  This is achieved by making one or more statements about either the state of or an action being performed by a subject where the subject is the main thing of interest and is usually performing the action.  So in it most basic form to convey meaning you need to state something about some object.  From a technical point of view statements are made via clauses.

There are various aspects that needs to be expressed when forming a sentence some of which have to be expressed to convey meaning and some which is reflects the view of the person expressing the meaning.

- Subject
- Predicate
- Number
- Tense
- Aspect
- Person
- Voice

The subject of a sentence is the person, thing, or concept that is of interest in the sentence.  If the sentence is expressing actions that are being performed it is usually the thing performing the action although depending on the voice being used that does not always hold true and if expressing the state of something is always the thing the state is begin expressed about.

The predicate is what you want to say about the subject it expresses some aspect of the state of the subject or some action that is either being performed by the subject or that is being performed on the subject or both as to express what you want to say about the subject may take multiple require multiple statements which is the function of clauses.

Number identifies whether the subject is singular or plural and is expressed via the subject. It is not always as straight forward to identify if the subject is singular or plural as it can depend on the context. e.g. in "The orchestra is playing a hit song." orchestra is singular as the action is the cumulative effect of the orchestra playing where as in "The orchestra were asked to give their musical backgrounds." orchestra is considered to be plural as it is being used as a collective reference to the members of the orchestra but the question is being asked of each member of the orchestra.  The verb used for the predicate needs to match the number of the subject which is known as subject verb agreement.

Tense provides the frame of reference in regards to the time relative to time that the statement is being made.  There are three tenses: past, present and future where past describes thing that have already occurred, present is thing that are occurring right now and future describes things that are going to occur at some point in the future.

Aspect describe how an action, event, or state extends over time and what aspect of that is pertinent to be emphasized.

Person indicates whose point of view is being expressed of which there are three classes first, second and third.  First person is the view of the speaker or a group that includes the speaker.  Second person is the point of view of someone talking to the speaker, you are expressing your interpretation of another person point of view.  Third Person is for when it is first or second person is not applicable.

Voice is how you define the subject of the sentence if you use an active voice the subject is the doer of the action whereas with the passive voice the subject is the target of the action.

## Clause

A clause is one or more statements, known as a predicate, about a subject, they differ from a sentence in that they can be independent or dependent.  An independent clause will include the subject as well as the statements where as a dependent clause does not contain its subject rather it is taken from the clause that it is dependent on.

The complexity of a sentence is defined by the number and type of clauses that a sentence contains, there are the definitions simple, compound, complex and compound complex.  A simple sentence contains a single independent clause.  A compound sentence consists of at least two independent clauses that are joined with a coordinating conjunction separated by a comma.  There are seven coordinating conjunctions for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so (FANBOYS).  A complex sentence has one or more dependent clauses (also called subordinate clauses) joined to an independent clause via a subordinating clause.  A sentence with two or more independent clauses plus one or more dependent clauses is called compound-complex or complex-compound.
